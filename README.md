# Weather App

A React-based weather application that displays local weather data. This app uses OpenWeatherMap for weather information and functions as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with push notifications.

## Features

- **Current Weather Conditions**: Temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more
- **7-Day Forecast**: Daily forecasts with high/low temperatures and precipitation chances
- **Location-based**: Uses your location to show relevant weather information
- **Canada-specific**: Optimized for Canadian locations with appropriate units (Â°C, km/h)
- **Progressive Web App**: Install on your device and use offline
- **Weather Alerts**: Push notifications for severe weather conditions
- **Customizable Notifications**: Set up alerts for specific weather conditions
